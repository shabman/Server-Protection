# Setting the member role

- !!setrole @role (must be a role mention)

-- This sets the member role which will be useful for later purposes (will explain later on)

# Setting the admin role

- !!setadmin @role (must be a role mention)

-- This sets the admin role so people with this role will have bypass features and won't be moderated.
-- If you set this to a member role, then the bot will moderate you.
